### Development Guidelines

#### Setup

[lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook#install) and [qmlfmt](https://github.com/jesperhh/qmlfmt) are used to format QML files. After cloning the repo, install `lefthook` & `qmlfmt` ([`qmlfmt-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qmlfmt-git) on the AUR), and run `lefthook install` to install the pre-commit hook.

#### Code Organization

1. **Modular Design**: Place new components in the appropriate directory:
   - `Modules/` - UI panels and major components
   - `Services/` - Logic and backend functionality
   - `Widgets/` - Reusable UI components
   - `Commons/` - Shared utilities and helpers

2. **Service-First Architecture**: Implement logic in services, keep UI components lightweight and focused on presentation.

3. **Widget Reusability**: Use existing widgets from `Widgets/` directory before creating new ones. The `N*` prefixed widgets are our custom components.

#### Code Quality Standards

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Study how similar features are implemented and follow the same patterns.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with proper logging using `Logger.qml`.

3. **Testing**: Test changes with both Hyprland and Niri compositors where applicable.

4. **Small PRs**: Prefer small, focused pull requests that are easier to review and test.

### Code Standards

**Avoid Qt5Compat**: We don't use `Qt5Compat` since it's deprecated and will be removed in future Qt versions. Instead, use modern Qt6 alternatives like `QtQuick.Effects` (especially `MultiEffect` for visual effects).

**JavaScript Syntax**: When writing JavaScript in QML files, avoid ES6+ syntax features like arrow functions, destructuring, or template literals. Stick to ES5 syntax that `qmlfmt` can properly format and validate. This ensures consistency across the codebase and prevents formatting issues.

:::warning[Code Formatting]
Always run `qmlfmt` on your QML files before submitting PRs. Modern JavaScript syntax may cause formatting errors or inconsistent output.

Don't worry about perfection - open an issue or start a discussion to iterate on ideas before or during implementation.
